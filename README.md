# process_csv_with_resque
This is a small example project of processing CSV file with Resque. Checkout this project and you can try it easily.

## Setup
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:johnny-miyake/process_csv_with_resque.git
$ cd process_csv_with_resque/
$ bundle install
$ rake db:migrate
$ bundle exec rake resque:work QUEUE="*"
(open another terminal and go to project dir)
$ rails s
```

## Usage
1. Open two tabs and access to `http://localhost:3000`(tab1) and `http://localhost:3000/resque`(tab2).
2. Select a CSV file ( `http://localhost:3000/clients.csv` is available) and upload it.
3. Reload tab1 and confirm that the data you have just uploaded has not been saved in DB yet.
4. Reload tab2 and confirm that a background job is being executed.
5. Wait for 30 seconds.
6. Reload tab1 again and confirm that the data you have uploaded is shown in the list.

relaunch the Resque worker every time you modify a worker script (e.g. `app/workers/import_csv.rb`).

## Explanation
Followings are explanations of some principal files on this application.

### configuration files
* `config/redis/development.conf`
This is the configuration file for redis. It is used for launching Redis server
and also used for initializing Resque client in `config/initializers/resque.rb`.
`config/initializers/resque.rb`.
```ruby
daemonize yes
port 6379
logfile ./log/redis_development.log
dbfilename ./db/development.rdb
```

* `config/initializers/redis.rb`
This is an initialize
```ruby
require "redis"
redis_conf_path = Rails.root.join("config/redis", "#{Rails.env}.conf")
redis_conf = File.read(redis_conf_path)
port = /port.(\d+)/.match(redis_conf)[1]
host = "localhost"
`redis-server #{redis_conf_path}`
res = `ps aux | grep redis-server`
unless res.include?("redis-server") && res.include?(redis_conf_path.to_s)
  raise "Couldn't start redis"
end
# You can do below if you use Redis directly in your application.
# $redis = Redis.new(host: host, port: port)
```

* `config/initializers/resque.rb`
This script initializes a Resque client.
```ruby
redis_conf_path = Rails.root.join("config/redis", "#{Rails.env}.conf")
redis_conf = File.read(redis_conf_path)
port = /port.(\d+)/.match(redis_conf)[1]
host = "localhost"
Resque.redis = Redis.new(host: host, port: port)
```

* `lib/tasks/resque.rake`
This is a Rake task used by Resque.
```ruby
require "resque/tasks"
task "resque:setup" => :environment
```

### Worker
`app/workers/import_csv.rb`
This is the worker for processing CSV file. It starts processing CSV after 30
seconds later it is called.
```ruby
class ImportCsv
  @queue = :default

  def self.perform(file)
    require "csv"
    sleep 30
    CSV.foreach(file, headers: true) do |row|
      Client.create(
        client_name: row[0],
        roman_name: row[1],
        tel: row[2]
      )
    end
  end
end
```

### Controller
`app/controllers/clients_controller.rb`
This is the controller for uploading CSV file. Job for uploading CSV file is
enqueued in create_by_csv action.

```ruby
class ClientsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @clients = Client.all
  end

  def create_by_csv
    path = "tmp/clients.csv"
    File.open path, "wb" do |f|
      f.puts params[:csv].read
    end
    Resque.enqueue ImportCsv, path
    redirect_to clients_path, notice: "enqueued."
  end

  def destroy
    @client = Client.find(params[:id])
    @client.destroy
    redirect_to clients_path
  end
end
```
